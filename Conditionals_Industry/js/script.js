/*When creating responsive websites, pixel widths need to be converted to percentage widths for the site to be viewed correctly on different sized device screens. In this calculation, we will use the target/context = result formula to calculate the percentage of an element compared to its container, which will be turned into a percentage.*/

//This variable will prompt the user to enter the width of their element in pixels
