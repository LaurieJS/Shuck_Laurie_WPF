/*When creating responsive websites, pixel widths need to be converted to percentage widths for the site to be viewed correctly on different sized device screens. In this calculation, we will use the target/context = result formula to calculate the percentage of an element compared to its container, which will be turned into a percentage.*/

//This variable will prompt the user to enter the width of their element in pixels
var elementWidth = prompt("Enter the width of the element in pixels:");

//This variable will prompt the user to enter the width of the element's container in pixels
var container = prompt("Enter the width of the element's container in pixels:");

//This else/if code will determine if the user prompts were left empty
if(elementWidth === ""){
	 elementWidth = prompt("Please enter the width of the element in pixels:");
}else if(){
